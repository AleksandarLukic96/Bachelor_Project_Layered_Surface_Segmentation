# Bachelor Project 
## Improving User Experience with Layered Surface Segmentation Tools

This is a Bachelor Project in Software Technology from Danish Techincal University(_DTU_).

The goal of this project is to improve the user experience and learning path of the segmentation tools available in the image analysis pip package, [slgbuilder](https://github.com/Skielex/slgbuilder). 

In order to provide the user with an intuitive understanding of the tools, a UI platform is provided, developed using _python_, _jupyter notebook_ and _Gradio_.

## Requirements and Dependencies

### Microsoft C++ Build Tools v.14.0
In the _slgbuilder_ package's dependencies we find the [thinmaxflow]() package. The package is used for computing min-cut/max-flow. To be able to download _thinmaxflow_ and therefore also _slgbuilder_, the user's machine must have Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater installed.

The tools can be downloaded and installed from [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). An easy and well explained guide is _Aditya Thakur's_ video on [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcI1_e38BWs&t=1s)
